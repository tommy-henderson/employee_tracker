# Employee Tracker

## Description

This project is a command-line employee database application. It allows the user to keep track of all their employees and data attributed to each employee. 

## Installation

Clone my GitHub Repo. Make sure you have inquirer, NodeJS, and MySQL installed. Start your database, add the schema and seeds to the database, and then type "node server.js" into your terminal to start the app. 

## Usage

After starting the application, the user is presented with a number of options. They can view their employees, add a new employee, update an employee's role, view all the roles, add a new role, view all the departments, and add a new department. See the gif below that demonstrates each of these functions:
